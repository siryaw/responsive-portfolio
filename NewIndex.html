                    Shalom! I am a former Pharmacy school student turned computer guru. This journey was not sunshine and rainbows but i'll spare you the details. I am on the road to Damascus. If you dont know what that means, you dont read your Bible enough. Nine months of training, I was born amphibious in Kumasi, Ghana. Twenty-three hours of the day, you'll probably find me Reading, Researching or Running because an investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. Some old man told me that so it's gotta be true, right? In the last hour, I'm probably looking for a permanent escape from monotony. Sustained by God, there isn't a blessing I wont receive. In a year or two, I will be a Software Developer for a Fortune 100 company in the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, Google, etc and retire my parents because they work too hard. Speak it into existence. Amen ooo. In my fathers house, there are many mansions but you'll find me at the Guy Fawkes Estate dripping with potential. Want the full version? Check back on your free time. Lets chat soon! - Yaw
